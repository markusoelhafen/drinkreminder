# Drink Reminder Chrome Extension

Drink Reminder is a simple chrome extension to remind you to drink enough during the day. Once started the extension will show a chrome notification.

Timespan between notifications can be specified in a simple options panel.

V0.1.2 adds the feature to start and stop the extension via omnibox. Typing "Drinkr" -> Space/Tab -> "start"/"stop" will run or stop the timer.

## Install Chrome App

Go to Chrome's Tools -> Extensions then click "Load unpacked extension...". Then click on Launch to get it working.
